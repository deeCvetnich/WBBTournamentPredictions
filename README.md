# Predicting Game Winners in the Women's March Madness Tournament

## Goal
  The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict winners in the women's March Madness tournament. 
 
## How?
  This project will be completed by webscraping women's NCAA tournament game data from https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/ and pages able to be reached from this page. This data will then be cleaned in preparation for input into the machine learning algorithms. Several algorithms will be tested in order to determine which gives the best results. Four seasons of data (2022, 2021, 2019, 2016) will be set aside for testing and validation purposes.
